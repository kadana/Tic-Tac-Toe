For my plugin I have the social sharing plugin. Its pulling up a cannot read property error on google chrome. To attempt to fix it I've tried changing the buttons to links with a direct link to the share pages of these social media sites (facebook and twitter). After doing reasearch on what the error that google was pulling back, it seems to be an issue with the js file being undefined or its pulling in an aspect of socialsharing (from the js) and something being undefined due to calling a something (be it a number, object or string) as a function.

I attempted to do a manual install of the plugin and it still didn't work. I ended up lost in the process of a manual install, and I looked over the javascript file of the plugin and couldn't find an error as to why the plugin is pulling back an undefined value. The only other option that I can think of is that it is pulling in this http://www.x-services.nl for the message and link to twitter and that may need a direct link option something that connects the user's social media account to the plugin. So the only untested option left is that I'm missing the code to connect the social media buttons to the users account due to the fact that I have no idea where to start to code something on that level.
